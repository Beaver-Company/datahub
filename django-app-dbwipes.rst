`DBWipes <http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ewu/dbwipes.html>`_ helps you quickly 
visualize data, identify outliers, and understand where those outliers arise 
from in the underlying data set. It is an extremelly powerful query builder and
data visualization too.

DBWipes files were updated in 2016-04-13 to close security vulnerabilities, and
allow collaborator and public users to access tables through DBWipes.
