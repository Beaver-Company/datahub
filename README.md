DataHub
===========
DataHub is an experimental hosted platform (GitHub-like) for organizing, managing, sharing, collaborating, and making sense of data. It provides an efficient platform and easy to use tools/interfaces for:

* Publishing of your own data (hosting, sharing, collaboration)
* Using otherâ€™s data (querying, linking)
* Making sense of data (analysis, visualization)

### Vagrant environment

Follow these steps:
1. You need internet access the first time you do these steps.
+ Download and install VirtualBox [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
+ Download and install Vagrant [https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
+ Add this line to your hosts file:
```
192.168.50.4    datahub-local.mit.edu
```
+ Then start the environment with:
```
vagrant up
```
+ Login into vagrant:
```
vagrant ssh
```
+ Start the app
```
cd /vagrant
sudo -s
source src/setup.sh
python src/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80
```
+ Then open the browser and go to [datahub-local.mit.edu](datahub-local.mit.edu)

+ When you are done

  + Press `CONTROL-C`
  + Exit the vm with `exit` (you need to execute it twice)
  + Shutdown the vm with `vagrant halt` (next time you do `vagrant up` will be much faster as packages are already installed; there is no need for internet connection).

  + If you want to delete the vm `vagrant destroy` (if you do `vagrant up` again, it will download and install all the packages).
