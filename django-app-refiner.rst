Refiner takes semi-structured data and example data, and structures it for
table creation.

Refiner is the result of Anant Bhardwaj's reserach. You can find a paper on it `here <https://github.com/datahuborg/datahub/blob/master/src/apps/refiner/presentation/data-refiner.pdf>`__.

.. note:: Refiner has since been interated upon. A new library named `Extract <https://github.com/CSAIL-LivingLab/extract>`__ has some significant improvements.
